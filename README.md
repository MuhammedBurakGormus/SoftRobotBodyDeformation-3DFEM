# SoftRobotBodyDeformation-3DFEM
---

The project is under development. At the moment, static analysis is achieved using Linear FEM (element type: Hexahedra with 27Nodes)

Forward Actions:
- Add Hexahedra 8 Nodes 
- Make the program compatible with dynamic motion
- Add Non-Linearity

---

The MATLAB GUI aims to analyze a rectangular prism domain using Finite Element Method for a soft robot body. The elements are 3D, namely Hexahedra with 27Nodes. Element type will be extended such that Hexagonal with 8Nodes will be used under dynamic motion to perform the analysis faster.

Here, the body is fixed at the YZ Plane, an it is subjected to vertical force at the tip.
